# Project 5 WatchMeAI | IoT
Final project in the Internet of Things course, in the field of electrical engineering, product and application development.
We dedicate the project to the memory of Michal Sela, in the hope that it will serve as a prototype for surveillance and security products for those who need it.

# Project 5 - WatchMeAI
- Chose to share this project as an example, to reflect my thought process and coding abilities with regards to:

	- Development of a product based on microcontroller - ESP32 and sensors:Acceleration, Storation and pulse meter and GPS.
  - Development using Arduino
	- Implement of learning models in order to detect stress or abnormal activity
	- Analysis and extracting insights from data
	- Advanced application development
	  
## How to review

- I recommend starting from reading the project report and the presentation overview guidlines, to understand the project (Project_Report.pdf, Presentation_Slides.pdf)

- Second, look into the Predictions part (Part_A_Predictions), there is a full explanation of the process

- Third, review the Arduino part (Arduino/final_arduino)

- Last, if the App interests you, extract the App.zip files, there is A LOT to see thereand this is the place for you.

- Depending on the field of expertise you would like to review, you can really start from anywhere...

## No code needed review (if you dont want to read any code files)
